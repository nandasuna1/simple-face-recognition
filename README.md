This code is based on the paper:
Simple Face-detection Algorithm Based on
Minimum Facial Features by Yao-Jiunn Chen, Yen-Chun Lin

The paper propouses real time face recognition using the Knoleged-based method with minimum features, adopting the geometric characteristics of skin and hair color to detect human faces. They also wanted to transplant this to an embebed system to make a pet robot.
